       just 8% of before, just 0.976% of QUOTE.TXT.
       Source code and .com program binary have been lost.
       In the header message, it is branded ``PotterSoftware Fortune Teller'',
       rather than ``PotterSoftware Quote Displayer''.

       Random number generator is fast.
       Released on 1996-09-22.
       quote6.8 is A86 3.22 .. 4.05 source code.
       quote6.nasm is NASM 0.98.39 source code.

* 2.63 From 2.62 some bugfixes and compatibility improvements with previous
       versions. It can print the last quote even if file not terminated by

       Work started on 2022-03-30. Also works on 8086 (not only 80286).
       quote63.nasm is NASM 0.98.39 source code.

       TODO: autodetect if the index file needs to be regenerated
       TODO: better handle quotes longer than 4096 bytes
       TODO: add quote.idx compatibility with version 2.64: keep idxc small
             so that it's at most 65535 quotes in 55 << 10 blocks
* 2.70 A DOS device driver (loadable from CONFIG.SYS) variant of 2.62,
